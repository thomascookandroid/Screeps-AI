/**
 * Converts a JavaScript value to a JSON5 string.
 * @param value The value to convert to a JSON5 string.
 * @param replacer Or a function that alters the behavior of the stringification
 * process. If this value is null or not provided, all properties of the object
 * are included in the resulting JSON5 string.
 * Or an array of String and Number objects that serve as a
 * allowlist for selecting/filtering the properties of the value object to be
 * included in the JSON5 string. If this value is null or not provided, all
 * properties of the object are included in the resulting JSON5 string.
 * @param space A String or Number object that's used to insert white space into
 * the output JSON5 string for readability purposes. If this is a Number, it
 * indicates the number of space characters to use as white space; this number
 * is capped at 10 (if it is greater, the value is just 10). Values less than 1
 * indicate that no space should be used. If this is a String, the string (or
 * the first 10 characters of the string, if it's longer than that) is used as
 * white space. If this parameter is not provided (or is null), no white space
 * is used. If white space is used, trailing commas will be used in objects and
 * arrays.
 * @param quote A String representing the quote character to use when serializing strings.
 * @returns The JSON5 string converted from the JavaScript value.
